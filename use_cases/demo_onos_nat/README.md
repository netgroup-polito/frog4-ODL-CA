## Run Mininet and ONOS

In order to run ONOS on top of a mininet network, you need to use the onos.py script provided in the [mininet](mininet/) folder.
Please, execute the following steps:

* copy the provided onos.py into the `~/onos/tools/dev/mininet/` folder (replace the older);
* copy in the same folder also all the `*.sh` scripts, which are needed to set up the networking of each mininet host;
* run both Mininet and ONOS using the command:
```
	$ cd ~/onos/tools/dev/mininet
	$ sudo mn --custom onos.py --controller onos,1 --topo tree,2,2
```
* once you are in the mininet CLI, run all scripts for each client:
```
	> h1 h1_script.sh
	> h2 h2_script.sh
	> h3 h3_script.sh
	> h4 h4_script.sh
```

## Install applications on ONOS

Inside the provided zip [](scripts/demo_scripts-onos.zip) there there are three scripts usefull to install ONOS applications needed for the demo.
The NAT application should be installed only during the second step.
