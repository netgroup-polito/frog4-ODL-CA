## Run Mininet and ONOS

In order to run ONOS on top of a mininet network, you need to use the onos.py script provided in the [mininet](mininet/) folder.
Please, execute the following steps:

* copy into the `~/onos/tools/dev/mininet/` folder, all the `*.sh` scripts, which are needed to set up the networking of each mininet host;
* run both Mininet and ONOS using the command:
```
	$ cd ~/onos/tools/dev/mininet
	$ sudo mn --custom onos.py --controller onos,1 --topo tree,2,2
```
* once you are in the mininet CLI, run all scripts for each client:
```
	> h1 ./h1_script.sh
	> h2 ./h2_script.sh
	> h3 ./h3_script.sh
	> h4 ./h4_script.sh
```

## Install applications on ONOS

Inside the [scripts/demo_scripts-onos](scripts/demo_scripts-onos) there there are three scripts usefull to install ONOS applications needed for the demo.

The [NAT](https://github.com/netgroup-polito/onos-applications/tree/master/nat) application should be installed only during the second step.

## Configuration

The [](config/) folder contains the configuration files and the domain descriptions json of all the orchestrators for the scenario of this demo.

## Graphs

Inside the [graphs](./graphs/) folder there is the high level graph deployed during the two steps of the demo. The folder also contains the sub-graphs that are generated by the frog4-orchestrator.

## Testing

Once the service graph has been deployed, you can do a ping between hosts `h1` and `h3` as follows.

```
	> h1 ping 20.0.0.10
```
